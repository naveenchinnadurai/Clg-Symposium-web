# Symposium Event Deatils Web

I've built a user-friendly multi-page website for our college's symposium, offering detailed descriptions of department's events in my college symposium. It's your handy guide to find all the details you need for a great symposium experience.

This is a static webite, facilitating easy access to detailed information for both participants and attendees of the symposium.

I've successfully deployed the site using vercel
